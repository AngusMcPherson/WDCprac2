<h1>Fancy background</h1>
<p>This page looks much cleaner nowthat i've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
<p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" repectively.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
</div>
<div>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</div>
